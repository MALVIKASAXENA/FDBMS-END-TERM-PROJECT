# Conclusion
In our data we have about 4.71% is subreddit which means that 4.71% data is a specific to some community/post whereas the rest 95.29% data is normal texts and has a parent id. From our modularity test we got to know we have 133 communities which is a high number which means we have dense connections between the nodes within modules but sparse connections between nodes in different modules. Through our modularity class we got to know that 6-7 communities dominate with 13.22% coming from community 5 (Pink) and 13.03% coming from community 58 (Green). After that from nested filters we got to know sentiment of each text whether it was positive/negative/neutral and grouped them accordingly. According to our data p31 is of a  positive sentiment , eg â€œFirst thing that pops into my head. Every time". We also got to know that 13.85% text were negative , 25.02% positive and rest were neutral . Then we say Edge weigh filter which is highest with p2573 (Source) and P2601(Target) which is 1160 (shows the strongest connection).
